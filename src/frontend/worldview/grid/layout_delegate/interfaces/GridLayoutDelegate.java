/**
 * GridLayoutDelegate is a functional interface that is used to translate the relative coordinates in a CellView's
 * CoordinateTuple to absolute coordinates at which it is to be displayed in a grid. The CellView's setX() and setY()
 * methods are then called with these absolute coordinates as parameters. 
 * 
 * A different GridLayoutDelegate should be implemented for all different layouts. Primarily, different LayoutManagers
 * are made for different shapes and different orientations of a particular shape.
 * 
 * The purpose of a GridLayoutDelegate is to encapsulate the math behind arranging shapes into a grid. It also makes
 * it easy to quickly swap out different grid layouts and use the same layout strategies for multiple grids.

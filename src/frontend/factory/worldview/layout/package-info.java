/**
 * The WorldView layout package specifies interfaces and classes that can be
 * used to determine the Grid's layout. This is an example of the Strategy
 * design pattern; the layout manager can be swapped out at runtime to change
 * the display shapes of the cells (from square to hexagonal, triangular, etc.)
 * simply by creating a new concrete layout manager.

/**
 * The WorldView factory package contains factory classes that set up a
 * WorldView to be displayed to the user. The WorldView objects themselves can
 * be manipulated further using the public interfaces that they implement. This
 * design pattern prevents client code from using methods that should not be
 * used (have not been put in the external interfaces) and hides any
 * dependencies that might exist between the UI components.

/**
 * The factory package contains factory classes that set up a number of
 * different UI classes. The UI classes themselves can be manipulated further
 * using the public interfaces that they implement. This design pattern prevents
 * client code from using methods that should not be used (have not been put in
 * the external interfaces) and hides any dependencies that might exist between
 * the UI components.

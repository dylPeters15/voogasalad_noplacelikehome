**Project Time Frame**

Work on this project began March 24 and ended on April 30 with an estimated total of 600 combined hours spent.

**Individual Contributions**

//TODO EVERYONE ADD THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS

* Faith Rodriguez (far10) contributed to the front end development of the project.  She created both the DetailPane and TemplatePane.  Additionally, she worked to implement dragging capabilities and editing capabilities for units, as well as other various tasks that came up as the project progressed, such as helping to switch a unit from belonging to a player to belonging to a team.


**Getting Started**

In order to run the project, use the class Main.java located in the default package within src.

**Testing**

The classes that were used to test this project can be found in the folder tests.

**Required Resources**

Resources required by the project, including images, sounds, and resource bundles, can be found within the resources package within the project.  Additionally, many front end packages contain their own resource package for items that are specific to only that part of the project.

**Using the project**

When joining a game that has been created by another player, one must know the creater's IP address and the server number that they are on. 

**Known Bugs and Limitations**

There are no known bugs in the project's functionality.

**Extra Features**

One extra feature that was implemented in this project is the extensive use of networking.  Players on different computers can both create and play games live-time with each other.  

**Overall Impressions**

This assignment, partially because of the genre that we chose, was very broad making it difficult to implement.  Trying to create a design flexible enough to support the entirety of our genre, as well as other genre's turned out to be a great challenge.

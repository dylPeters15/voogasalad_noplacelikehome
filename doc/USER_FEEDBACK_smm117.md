#Problems

- User put his name instead game name into GameWizard
- Adding units isn't intuitive; "How do you add units?"
- Have to re-click terrain/unit to add more than one

#Suggestions

- Should indicate that something happened when you hit "next" in the wizards
- Add highlighting/some indicator that the user clicked on a unit/terrain
- Add drag and drop for units/terrains
- Allow user to place more than one unit/terrain without going back to template pain
- "Can you edit the unit by clicking on it?"
- Add ghost text to chat client to make it clearer what you type in each textbox
- Make it clear how to collapse the chat box
- Be able to delete a cell in the middle of the grid that units can't move to/be placed on
